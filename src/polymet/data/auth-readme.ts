/**
 * AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
 * ====================================
 *
 * This file documents the Google Authentication integration for the Interview Roster App.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * The authentication system uses React Context to manage user authentication state
 * throughout the application. It's designed to integrate with Google OAuth but currently
 * includes mock authentication for development purposes.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * ### 1. AuthContext (@/polymet/data/auth-context)
 *
 * The central authentication context that provides:
 * - `user`: Current authenticated user object with name, email, picture, and role
 * - `isLoading`: Boolean indicating if authentication state is being checked
 * - `signIn()`: Function to trigger Google OAuth sign-in
 * - `signOut()`: Function to sign out the current user
 *
 * ### 2. AuthProvider Component
 *
 * Wraps the entire application to provide authentication context to all components.
 * Located in: @/polymet/prototypes/interview-roster-app
 *
 * ### 3. DashboardLayout Integration
 *
 * The DashboardLayout component automatically consumes authentication data:
 * - User profile picture from Google OAuth response
 * - User name from Google OAuth response
 * - User role badge
 * - Sign out functionality
 *
 * ## User Data Flow
 *
 * 1. User signs in via Google OAuth (or mock authentication)
 * 2. User data is stored in AuthContext state
 * 3. User data is persisted to localStorage for session management
 * 4. DashboardLayout reads user data via useAuth() hook
 * 5. User profile picture and name are displayed in sidebar
 * 6. Navigation is filtered based on user role
 *
 * ## User Object Structure
 *
 * interface User {
 *   name: string;        // Full name from Google profile
 *   email: string;       // Email from Google account
 *   picture: string;     // Profile picture URL from Google
 *   role: "viewer" | "talent" | "admin";  // Application role
 * }
 *
 * ## Integration with Google OAuth
 *
 * ### Current Implementation (Mock)
 *
 * The current implementation uses mock authentication for development:
 * - Automatically signs in with a default user
 * - Stores user data in localStorage
 * - Simulates OAuth flow
 *
 * ### Production Implementation
 *
 * To integrate with real Google OAuth, you would need to:
 * 1. Install Google OAuth library
 * 2. Update AuthProvider to use real OAuth
 * 3. Implement proper token management
 *
 * ## Role-Based Access Control
 *
 * The system supports three roles:
 * - **viewer**: Read-only access to most features
 * - **talent**: Can manage interviewers and mark attendance
 * - **admin**: Full access including settings and audit logs
 *
 * ## Components
 *
 * ### GoogleSignInButton (@/polymet/components/google-sign-in-button)
 * Reusable button component for triggering Google sign-in.
 *
 * ### LoginPage (@/polymet/pages/login-page)
 * Full login page with Google sign-in button and branding.
 * Automatically redirects to dashboard if user is already authenticated.
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 *
 * 1. Token Storage: In production, use secure HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
 * 2. Token Refresh: Implement token refresh logic for long-lived sessions
 * 3. HTTPS Only: Always use HTTPS in production
 * 4. CSRF Protection: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
 * 5. Role Validation: Always validate roles on the backend, never trust client-side roles
